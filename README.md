# Genomic Analysis of Canis lupus

Comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes was performed after downloading data from the NCBI database. The reference genome was the domestic dog, and we compared it with other canids. The analysis was performed using Docker software.

 In the Phylogenetic Analysis, we used sequences from the GenBank database. In SeaView, we performed the Aligment. In jModelTest, we determined the optimal models for the following sequences. Using MrBayes, we determined the final phylogenetic tree.
